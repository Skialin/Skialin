 * bindgen cannot cross on its own: factory statics and methods that return
 * or consume sk_sp<T>, since sk_sp is a template and its instantiations
 * are not directly callable through a generated binding. Every function
 * here takes/returns a raw, already-ref-managed pointer so the Rust side
 * owns a plain pointer with clear, explicit lifetime rules. */
